# Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a reliable and safe peer-to-peer (P2P) file storage system that uses a decentralized network for file management and sharing. We will accomplish this by utilizing the Kademlia. Data integrity, security, and user-friendliness are guaranteed by the system's extensive feature set, which includes version control, access control, data encryption, and auditing.
